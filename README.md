# Simple File Viewer

This is a simple web application that I created to fulfil one purpose. I am learning a new language and some materials I want to study are available in text files. I want to be able to use convenient Google Chrome extensions to perform actions such as dictionary and symbol lookups on the text in any of these files. As this is not possible in any file viewer, I enable this by providing this simple web application that allows the user to upload a text file to their browser and then have access to any features that their browser extensions provide on the text.
